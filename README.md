# SmallJSONParser #

This is a simple, one-file JSON parser in C. It is designed for highly
resource-constrained systems. It uses no memory allocation, and can stream
data, so that the whole file does not need to reside in memory.

It does not actually convert the JSON structure into a native data structure
or tree. Instead, it works more like a tokeniser, and finds each primitive
value in turn, and also reports when an object or array starts or ends.

The application then follows along with the structure, and extracts the data
it needs as it encounters it. The implementation also includes a set of
helper functions to make this easier.

## Simplifications ##

In order to keep code size down, the parser actually parses a simplified JSON
syntax. Any well-formed JSON data will be parsed correctly by the simplified
grammar, but many kinds of JSON data that a strict parser would not accept
will be accepted by this parser.

* `:` and `,` are ignored entirely.
* `]` and `}` are treated as interchangeable.
* Any bareword of any length starting with `t` is treated as a `true` value.
* Any bareword of any length starting with `f` is treated as a `false` value.
* Any bareword of any length starting with `n` is treated as a `null` value.
* Number parsing may be less strict that the spec requires.

For instance, this can be parsed as valid data: `{"a" t "b" f "c" [1 2 3}}`.

## API documentation ##

The API contains several layers, all quite simple.

### Minimal API ###

At this level, the parser is supplied with a buffer of memory containing JSON
data, and the parsing function is called repeatedly, returning one token per
call. When the end of buffer is reached, the parser may return a partial
token (for instance, if the buffer ends in the middle of a string value).

Once the end of the buffer has been released, a new buffer with the following
data can be supplied, and the parser will carry in where it left off, and
return the remaining data of any partial token it previously returned.

If the whole JSON structure can be fit into one buffer, partial tokens do not
need to be handled.

Value data is returned in tokens simply as start and end pointers into the
original data. You can access this data directly yourself, or you can use the
token parsing API functions, defined further down, to parse string and
number values.

#### Functions ####

	void InitialiseJSONParser(JSONParser *self);

Initialise a `JSONParser` structure. Call this before starting parsing, or to
restart a parser from scratch. `self` is an uninitialised `JSONParser`.

	void ProvideJSONInput(JSONParser *self,const void *bytes,size_t length);

Provide input for the `JSONParser` `self`. `bytes` is a pointer to the bytes
of JSON data, and `length` is the number of bytes.

	JSONToken NextJSONToken(JSONParser *self);

Find the next token from the JSON data being parsed by the `JSONParser`
`self`, The `start` field of the returned `JSONToken` structure is a pointer
to the first byte of the value for this token. The `end` filed points to one
past the end of the value. `typeandflags` contains a combination of the
token type and flags for the token.

If the end of the data provided to the the `JSONParser` is reached while
looking for the next token, the type of the token will be
`OutOfDataJSONToken`.

If the end of the data provided to the the `JSONParser` is reached while
looking for the end of a found token, the returned token will be marked as
partial, and the value will contain only as much of the token's value as
was available.

If a partial token is returned, then the next call to this function after
providing more data through the `ProvideJSONInput` function will be a token
of the same type, whose `start` and `end` pointers contain only the newly
available data, not the earlier data. The value will have to be manually
reconstructed if it is of interest.

	int JSONTokenType(JSONToken token);

Returns the type of the `JSONToken` `token`. This will be one of the
`*JSONToken` values.

	bool IsJSONTokenPartial(JSONToken token);

Checks if the `JSONToken` `token` is partial, i.e., if it the token extends
past the end of the current buffer.

### Pull API ###

To facilitate streaming data through the parser, a slightly higher-level API
is provided on top of the minimal API. With this API, you provide a callback
function that loads and provides data to the parser as needed. You also
provide a memory buffer that is used to reconstruct partial tokens across
buffer boundaries.

If a token needs reconstructed, the start and end pointers of the returned
token will be pointing into the reconstruction buffer instead of into the
original data.

As the reconstruction buffer is of fixed size, if a value is too big to fit
into the provided memory, it is truncated to fit, and any remaining data is
discarded. If this is a problem, you should use the minimal API to handle
reconstructing tokens yourself, or just load the entire JSON struture into
memory so there are no buffer boundaries to deal with.

#### Functions ####

	typedef bool JSONInputProviderCallbackFunction(JSONParser *parser,void *context);

An input provider callback function. `parser` is the `JSONParser` structure
that needs more input, and `context` is the arbitrary context pointer
provided to `InitialiseJSONProvider`.

The function should fetch more data, then call `ProvideJSONInput` on
`parser`, then return `true`. Alternatively, it should return `false` to
indicate that there is no more input available.

	void InitialiseJSONProvider(JSONProvider *self,
	JSONInputProviderCallbackFunction *callback,void *context,void *buffer,size_t buffersize);

Initialise a `JSONProvider` structure. `JSONParser` is responsible for
streaming input to a `JSONParser`, by using the function supplied through
`callback`. `context` is an arbitrary pointer that is passed on to the
callback as extra data.

It is also responsible for providing a memory buffer for reassembling
partial tokens when needed. This buffer is passed in through the `buffer`
argument, and its size through `buffersize`. Make sure this buffer is large
enough to fit the largest value you are interested in.

Up to one byte less than the available buffer size will be used when
reconstructing the value, in order to leave space for a possible terminating
zero byte added by `UnescapeJSONStringTokenInPlace()`.

	JSONToken NextJSONTokenWithProvider(JSONParser *self,JSONProvider *provider);

Find the next token from the JSON data being parsed by the `JSONParser`
`self`, and provided by the `JSONProvider` `provider`. The `start` field of
the returned `JSONToken` structure is a pointer to the first byte of the
value for this token. The `end` filed points to one past the end of the
value. `typeandflags` contains a combination of the token type and flags for
the token.

If the end of the stream provided by the `JSONProvider` is reached while
looking for the next token, the type of the token will be
`OutOfDataJSONToken`.

If the value of a token extends across the buffer edges as provided by
`JSONProvider`, the token value will be reassembled in the buffer supplied by
the `JSONProvider`, and the `start` and `end` values will point into this
buffer instead of into the actual JSON data.

If there is not enough space to reassemble the token value, it will be
flagged as truncated.

	bool IsJSONTokenTruncated(JSONToken token);

Checks if the `JSONToken` `token` is truncated, i.e., if it needed to be
reassembled by `NextJSONTokenWithProvider()` but there was not enough buffer
space to do so.

### Token parsing API ###

These functions help with extracting data from string and number values.
Numbers can be parsed both as integers or floating-point values. Strings can
be processed to expand escape codes, including Unicode escapes which are
converted into UTF-8. String escape expansion an either be done in-place or
into a separate buffer. If it is done in-place, the original data buffer is
modified, so make sure this is possible and acceptable.

#### Functions ####

	bool UnescapeJSONStringToken(JSONToken token,char *unescapedbuffer,char **end);

Unescape a JSON string token `token`, handing both escape codes such as \n
and \r, and Unicode escapes like \u2619, which are converted to UTF-8. The
result is stored in `unescapedbuffer`, and terminated with a zero byte.
This buffer must be at least as long  as the length of the token, plus one
for the terminating zero byte (`end - start + 1`).

	bool UnescapeJSONStringTokenInPlace(JSONToken *token);

Unescape a JSON string token `token`, handing both escape codes such as \n
and \r, and Unicode escapes like \u2619, which are converted to UTF-8. The
result overwrites the existing data, and a zero byte is added for
termination. The result is pointed to by `start` after the conversion is
finished.

This function overwrites data provided by `ProvideJSONInput()`, so make sure
this is possible and acceptable before calling it.

	bool FastIsJSONStringEqual(JSONToken token,const char *string);

Quickly compare whether the string value in the `JSONToken` `token` is equal
to a given string or not. The string value is not unescaped in any way.

	bool FastIsJSONStringEqualWithLength(JSONToken token,const char *string,size_t length);

Quickly compare whether the string value in the `JSONToken` `token` is equal
to a given string for which the length is already known, or not. The string
value is not unescaped in any way.

	bool ParseNumberTokenAsInteger(JSONToken token,int *result);

Parse the number value of the `JSONToken` `token`, assuming it is an
integer. The result is stored in `result`, and the function returns `true`
if conversion succeeded, else `false`.

	bool ParseNumberTokenAsFloat(JSONToken token,float *result);

Parse the number value of the `JSONToken` `token`, converting it to a
`float`. The result is stored in `result`, and the function returns `true`
if conversion succeeded, else `false`.

Note: This function copies the token value string into a buffer on the stack
while converting. Make sure the value is not so big it will overflow the
stack before calling.

	bool ParseNumberTokenAsDouble(JSONToken token,double *result);

Parse the number value of the `JSONToken` `token`, converting it to a
`double`. The result is stored in `result`, and the function returns `true`
if conversion succeeded, else `false`.

Note: This function copies the token value string into a buffer on the stack
while converting. Make sure the value is not so big it will overflow the
stack before calling.
